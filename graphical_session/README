The top level of this directory contains code for "driving" the GUI version
of Phatbooks. We eschew wxWidgets' macro-created main function, and
instead drive everything from our own main defined in main.cpp
at the top-level project directory, via our GraphicalSession class
(a subclass of phatbooks::Session).
However we still need to go through the motions of creating a "MyApp" class in
which to contain all our wxWidgets-using code. We contain this MyApp class in
the "wxs" subdirectory, along with other code that directly interfaces
with the wxWidgets library.
