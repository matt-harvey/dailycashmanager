The top level of this directory contains code for driving the GUI version
of Phatbooks, that is NOT wxWidgets-dependent. The subdirectory "wx" contains
that all of the codebase that depends on wxWidgets.

We eschew wxWidgets' macro-created main function, and instead drive everything
from our own main defined in main.cpp at the top-level project directory.

However we still need to go through the motions of creating a "MyApp" class in
which to contain all our wxWidgets-using code. We contain this MyApp class in
the "wx" subdirectory.
