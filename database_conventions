*** Database Design and Naming Conventions to be used in Phatbooks ***

The database should be design in Third Normal Form. Denormalization should
only occur if there are performance problems, and denormalization would solve
those problems.

Table names should be plural and in lower case. No prefix.

Primary keys should be autoincrementing integer primary keys unless there is
a very good reason for them not to be.

Composite primary keys should be avoided.

The primary key should be the first column in the table.

Primary keys should be named as the singular form of the table, followed
by "_id".

Foreign keys should be named as the singular form of the foreign table,
followed by "_id". Thus a foreign key will have the same name as the
corresponding primary key.

Columns that are neither primary keys nor foreign keys should not be prefixed
with the table name.

Underscores should be used to separate words within a table or column name.

Capital letters should not be used in table or column names.
