// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Under KDE (at least on Mageia) the way I have set
// up the widths of wxComboBox and wxTextCtrl and wxButton (in various
// controls in which these feature), where they are
// supposed to be the same height, they actually turn out to be slightly
// different heights. However even if I manually set them all to the same
// hard-coded height number, they still seem to come out different heights
// on KDE. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Go through all the classes inheriting from
// sqloxx::PersistentObject<...> and ensure the do_save(...) functions in each
// are atomic with respect to the in-memory objects (noting that Sqloxx
// already ensures atomicity with respect to the database), and that they
// conform to the restrictions detailed in the sqloxx::PersistentObject<...>
// API documentation. (Note I have already done this for \e do_load(...)
// functions.)

// TODO MEDIUM PRIORITY Tooltips aren't showing on Windows.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Make the installer create an association on the user's
// system between the Phatbooks file extension and the Phatbooks application.
// See CMake book, page. 162.

/// TODO MEDIUM PRIORITY The database file should perhaps have a checksum to
// guard against its contents changing other than via the application.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Facilitate automatic checking for updates from user's
// machine, or at least provide an easy process for installing updates
// via NSIS. It appears that the default configuration of CPack/NSIS is
// such that updates will not overwrite existing files. Some manual NSIS
// scripting may be required to enable this. Also take into account that
// the user may have to restart their computer in the event that they have
// files open while the installer (or "updater") is running (although I
// \e think that the default configuration under CPack does this
// automatically).

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Create a decent icon for the application. We want this
// in both .ico form (for Windows executable icon) and .xpm
// form (for icon for Frame). Note, when I exported my
// "token icon" using GIMP to .ico format, and later used this
// to create a double-clickable icon in Windows, only the text
// on the icon appeared, and the background image became
// transparent for some reason. Furthermore, when set as the
// large in-windows icon in the CPack/NSIS installer, the icon
// wasn't showing at all. Once decent icon is created, also make sure it is
// pulled into the wxBitmap in SetupWizard.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Create a better name for the application.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Make the GUI display acceptably on smaller screen
// i.e. laptop.

// TODO MEDIUM PRIORITY Startup time under Windows is really slow, even when
// compiled in Release mode.

// TODO HIGH PRIORITY Put the standard Apache License, Version 2.0 copyright
// notice block at the top of files other than just ".hpp" and ".cpp" files.
