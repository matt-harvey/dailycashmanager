***** Notes on string handling *****

The need to make things work with Unicode, and across multiple platforms, and
to be able to store data consistently in a database that might be opened by
the same user on different operating systems, means that string handling requires some care.
At the same time, we must be able to work with our chosen GUI framework, wxWidgets,
which requires that strings be in a particular format.

The application can be broken horizontally into three Layers, as follows.
	-	The Database Layer. In DCM, the functions at this layer are all and
		only those in the sqloxx namespace. This is basically everything in the
		Sqloxx library (which in turns is a wrapper around SQLite).
	-	The Business Layer. In DCM, the functions at this layer are all and
		only those in the dcm namespace, that are NOT also in the tui or
		gui namespace. Functions belonging to business classes such as
		dcm::Account are typical examples of functions at the Business
		Layer. We need to decide, for those of these functions that accept or
		return strings, what sort of strings they should accept and return.
	-	The Presentation Layer. In DCM, the functions at this layer all ond
		only those in either the dcm::gui or the dcm::tui namespace.
		The presentation layer can be broken into two "Faces", as follows.
			- The TUI Face - anything in the dcm::tui namespace, or the console
					mode of the application. There are two "Subfaces":
						- The Linux Subface.
						- The Windows Subface.
			- The GUI Face - anything in the dcm::gui namespace, or the GUI
					mode of the application. There are two "Subfaces":
						- The Linux Subface.
						- The Windows Subface.

OK, so that's the overall architecture of the application. What we need to ensure
is that when we are handling strings at any given Layer, Face or Subface, that we
are using an appropriate form of string, given the requirements we have outlined to
be able to handle Unicode, to work across multiple platforms, and to work with the
wxWidgets toolkit. Our reasoning about what form of string to use at each layer, is
as follows.

	-	The Database Layer. In this layer, strings must be stored in a consistent
	    format regardless of the operating system in which they were originally
		inserted into the database, and regardless of the operating system in which
		they are eventually retrieved. Thus a string inserted into the database
		during a Windows session must preserve its integrity when later retrieved
		on Linux. Etc. This entails, among other things, that the string format for
		database storage must avoid any possible issues with endianness. The string
		format must also be storable by SQLite, without too much fuss.
		The appropriate storage format to use here is going to be either a string
		of char, or a string of wchar_t, since these are the string formats supported by
		SQLite. However, wchar_t MIGHT have endianness issues. I think it probably
		wouldn't as SQLite is probably designed so this doesn't arise; however, we
		KNOW that with char these issues CAN'T arise. So we might as well store
		things as strings of char. This entails UTF-8 format. At the SQLoxx level,
		this entails passing std::string to the SQLoxx API - which, happily, is
		already written to accept std::string and not std::wstring. Therefore, as
		far as DCM is concerned, it needs to pass UTF-8 encoded std::string
		to the SQLoxx API, and it needs to be prepared to received UTF-8 encoded
		std::string from the SQLoxx API. (Note, it is possible to configure SQLite
		with ICU support, so that, for example, you might sort strings by
		"alphabetical order" within SQLite select statements etc.., in a locale-aware
		way. But I don't want to go down that route at this stage. It seems like
		something I could achieve more easily at the Business Layer if I ever
		needed to do that kind of processing. The SQLite book makes it sound like
		the integration of ICU support into SQLite is potentially complicated. In any
		case, my impression from the SQLite documentation is that even if you
		do build it with the ICU extension, this has nothing to do with the format in
		which strings are stored in the database. It might affect what indexes
		you create in the database, but it doesn't seem to impinge on the storage
		format of the text itself.)

	-	The Business Layer. This is the layer in which the business logic of the
		application takes place. It is desirable that we be able to perform
		Unicode-aware operations at this layer. It is also desirable, for efficiency
		reasons, that data loaded into the cache - which lives at the business
		later - be already encoded in the form that it will finally be presented in
		at the GUI layer. This enables us to leverage the caching that we have already
		put in place, to avoid having to convert between string formats more often
		that necessary. This all strongly points to using wxString as our format
		at the Business Layer. Some notes re. wxString in wxWidgets 2.9:
			-	wxString in wxWidgets version 2.9 is different to 2.8. We have
			    installed 2.9 on both Linux and Windows and are going to be building
				our application with 2.9.
			-	To initialize a wxString with string literals, you can use either
				wide or narrow string literals directly (i.e. either L"hello"
				or "hello" will work).
			-	wxString::char_type and wxString::value_type are both wxUniChar.
				Thus a wxString represents a sequence of Unicode codepoints. This is
				good. You can iterate over them, and you can also index into them
				to pull out individual codepoints.
			-	On Windows, a wxString embodies a UTF-16-encoded string. On Linux,
			    it embodies either a UTF-32-encoded string, or a UTF-8-encoded string,
				depending on the wxWidgets build configuration. We have chosen the
				UTF-8 configuration, to minimize the size of the object cache.
				For clients of wxString, however, this is all much of a muchness, since
				regardless of what kind of encoding it uses internally, it is always
				conceptually a "string of Unicode codepoints".
			-	If we want to print a wxString to standard output, using a standard
				library stream, we need to use std::cout in Linux, assuming we want
				non-ASCII characters to appear. (In Windows this will make
				non-ASCII characters disappear, but then we don't care about
				Windows non-GUI console so much.)
	
	-	The Presentation Layer. This is the layer at which console and GUI output is presented
		to the user. We really need to consider each "Face" separately.
			-	The TUI Face
				-	In Linux, the only way (but see below) we can write the the console in
					a Unicode friendly
				    way is by writing to std::cout. This is easy to do though. The wxString
					can be written directly to std::cout and it just works, including with
					non-ASCII characters.
					Having said this, we have already got all the TUI code working
					with std::string, including moderately complex stuff like
					consolixx::Table. It is probably better to retain std::string
					as the string class to use in these routines. Where convenient, though
					we can write wxString directly to std::cout too.
				-	In Windows, it's difficult to write non-ASCII characters to the console.
					So difficult that, in fact, I don't think I could be bothered trying to make
					it work at this point. (OK, I HAVE tried to make it work, using hints
					from Stack Overflow, but failed. I didn't try very hard, but I tried...)
					If and when I try to make it work properly, the way to do that
					is (I think) by writing to std::wcout, NOT to std::cout. But in
					the meantime, I can get away with writing to std::cout since I am resigning
					myself to only dealing in ASCII when in Windows console mode anyway.
				-	In conclusion, the string type to use for the TUI Face, both on Linux and
					Windows, is std::string, while also being able to write
					wxString straight to std::cout where convenient.
			- The GUI Face
				-	There is only one choice here, really, and that is wxString. The functions
					for displaying strings in windows etc. generally take wxString, or at least,
					that is their obvious, well-documented interface.
					I have verified that if you just pass wxString to the
					widget-related functions as stated in the wxWidgets documentation, then
					non-ASCII characters are displayed properly, both in Linux and in Windows.

In conclusion:
	
	- The Database Layer: use UTF-8 encoded std::string.
	- The Business Layer: use wxString.
	- The Presentation Layer:
		- The TUI Face: use std::string, std::cin and std::cout, on both Windows and Linux.
		  However, we can permit ourselves to write wxString straight to std::cout
		  where convenient.
		- The GUI Face: use wxString on both Windows and Linux.
