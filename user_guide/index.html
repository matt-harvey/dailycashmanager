		<h1>Envelope Budgeting</h1>
		</div>

		<h2>What is envelope budgeting?</h2>
		<p>
		The "envelope system" of budgeting is based
		on the idea that every unit of wealth (every dollar, pound,
		Euro...) <em>has a job</em>. When money is earned, every
		unit of that money is immediately assigned a task. For example,
		suppose I earn a $500 paycheck. I might assign $20 to
		Entertainment, $100 to Food, $80 to Electricity, $200 to rent,
		and $100 to retirement savings. When I want to spend some money, I
		will have a range of "envelopes", each with a
		certain balance - a certain amount of money available for
		me to spend on that category. If I have $100 in the Food envelope,
		I am only allowed to spend $100 on Food - until, that is,
		the Food envelope is again topped up from the next lot of income.
		That's the basic idea.
		</p>
		<p>
		The beauty of envelope budgeting is that if you know how much
		you spend, on average, on a given category of spending, you can
		plan ahead by allocating the right amount to that category in
		advance, so that the money is there when you need it. Say you
		spend $1,000 a year on electricity. Divide that $1,000 into 52
		weeks, and you would allocate $19.23 each week into your
		electricity envelope. Because you are <em>only</em> allowed
		to spend the money in this envelope on electricity, the money
		simply builds up in this envelope, until your next electricity
		bill arrives - when it is most needed.
		</p>

		<h2>Framing a budget</h2>
		<p>
		A <em>budget</em> is a plan for how money should be earned and
		spent. In envelope budgeting terms, this means creating a
		recurring allocation to each envelope on the basis of how much,
		on average, is expected to be spent from each envelope over time.
		For example, if I estimate that I will spend $1,000 per year on
		electricity, $8,000 a year on food and $2,000 a year on holidays,
		I could construct a weekly budget in which I allocate
		the appropriate amount each week, as set out in the following
		table.
