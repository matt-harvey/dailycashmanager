    <p>
      <em>On Windows</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Double click on the downloaded binary installer, which should be named
      &quot;DailyCashManager setup.exe&quot;, or similar. This will start the
      graphical installer; then simply follow the prompts.
    </p>

      <em>On Linux</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently to install DCM on Linux, the application must be compiled from
      source. Uncompress the tarball or zipball, and <code>cd</code> into the
      resulting source directory. Follow the instructions in README.rst to build,
      test and install the application.

      <h3>Running DailyCashManager for the first time</h3>
      <p>
        <em>On Windows</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Double-click the DailyCashManager icon in the Start menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On Linux</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter <code>dailycashmanager</code> at the command line.

      <h3>Creating a DailyCashManager file</h3>
      <p>
        When you first run DCM, the application needs to create a file in which to
        store your data. A small panel will be displayed on startup, titled,
        &quot;Welcome to DailyCashManager!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on <em>Create a new DailyCashManager file</em>; the
        <em>DailyCashManager Setup Wizard</em> will then guide through the
        process of setting up your DCM file.
      </p>

      <div id="file-name-location-currency-and-starting-date" class="js-ug-section">
        <h4>File name, location, currency and starting date</h4>
        <p>
          The first page of the wizard will ask you to select a location to save
          your DCM file. Click the <em>Browse...</em> button to browse your
          filesystem and select a suitable location. It doesn't matter much where
          you save the file, as long as you can easily remember where you saved
          it. By default, the new file will be saved in your home folder; if
          you're happy for it to be saved here, you can just leave this option
          unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, enter a name for your new file. This defaults to your user name,
          but you can enter any other name you choose, providing it is a valid
          filename on your system. The &quot;.dcm&quot; extension will be
          automatically added to whatever filename you enter; do not type
          &quot;.dcm&quot; in the box yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, select your currency from the drop-down list provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on what currency you select, the box titled <em>Confirm the
          precision of your currency</em> will display a &quot;0&quot; with a
          number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point
          corresponding to minor currency unit (cents, pence or etc.) of the
          currency. For example, if you selected &quot;United States dollar
          (USD)&quot;, this box would display &quot;0.00&quot;, because there are
          100 cents in the dollar. If you didn't want to keep track of cents (or
          whatever your minor currency unit happens to be) you could change this
          box to read just &quot;0&quot;. However it is highly recommended that
          you do <em>not</em> do this. Except in some special cases, it is best
          to leave this box unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also be asked to enter a &quot;starting date&quot;. This is
          the date from which you will start entering transactions, and will
          default to today's date. If you will only be entering transactions
          starting from today, you can leave this as is. However, to ensure the
          integrity of your data, you will not be able to enter transactions
          dated earlier than the date you enter here. If you have a backlog of
          past-dated transactions that you want to enter into your newly created
          DCM file, you should set this date to the date of the earliest
          transaction that you will be entering.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are happy with your selections here, click <em>Next</em> and
          you will be taken to the next page of the wizard.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="setting-up-accounts" class="js-ug-section">
        <h4>Setting up accounts</h4>
        <p>
          The next page asks you to enter your assets and liabilities, with the
          current balances of each. An asset represents an amount of money that
          you &quot;own&quot;&mdash;such as a chequing account or savings account&mdash;
          and a liability represents an amount that you &quot;owe&quot;&mdash;such as
          a credit card balance or loan. The wizard provides you with some
          suggested asset and liability accounts to get you started; however you
          can and should edit these to match the accounts that you actually have.
          You can edit the <em>Account name</em>, <em>Type</em>,
          <em>Description</em> and <em>Starting balance</em> boxes directly. The
          <em>Description</em> is optional; you can enter a description of the
          account here for your own benefit if you feel the need.  The
          <em>Starting balance</em> box contains the amount of money in the
          account as at the starting date (which will be today's date, unless you
          entered a different starting date on the previous page); in the case of
          a liability such as a credit card, this should normally be a negative
          number (appearing in parentheses). If you want to add more accounts,
          click the <em>Add account</em> button at the top right and a new row
          will be created for you to populate with the details of the new
          account. You can add as many other accounts as you like. To remove any
          accounts that you don't need, use the checkboxes to the right to select
          the accounts you want to remove, and click the <em>Remove checked</em>
          button.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you've finished configuring your accounts, click <em>Next</em> at
          the bottom right, to advance to the next page of the wizard.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="setting-up-envelopes" class="js-ug-section">
        <h4>Setting up envelopes</h4>
        <p>
          The next page asks you to enter some revenue and expenditure
          categories.  These will form the initial &quot;envelopes&quot; that you
          use to classify your transactions. As with the account setup page, you
          can add envelopes by clicking the button at the top right, labelled
          <em>Add envelope</em> in this case, or remove envelopes by clicking the
          <em>Remove checked</em> button, respectively. You can edit the boxes
          for the <em>Name</em>, <em>Type</em> and <em>Description</em> of each
          envelope directly. The <em>Description</em> field is optional.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will notice that each envelope has an <em>Initial allocation</em>
          cell; this is to contain the amount of funds you want to allocate to
          the envelope initially, at the starting date, for budgeting purposes.
          As a rule of thumb, you should allocate to each envelope enough money
          to cover the most that you would normally spend on that category in a
          single transaction. For example, if you usually spend at most 50.00 on
          food &quot;in one hit&quot;, you should initially allocate about 50.00
          to your &quot;Food&quot; envelope. This is only a rough guide however.
          If you are not expecting to spend from a particular envelope for
          another few weeks or months, then probably don't need to allocate the
          full amount. For example, if you spend about 600.00 every 3 months on
          electricity, and you're not expecting your next electricity bill for
          another month, then you would only need to allocate about 400.00 to
          &quot;Electricity&quot; to begin with. When you set up budget items
          (you can read about this under <a href="#budgeting"
          class="js-ug-internal-link">Budgeting</a>), if you allocate 600.00 per 3 months
          to this envelope, this will ensure that the envelope balance reaches
          the targetted 600.00 by the time the electricity bill arrives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if this doesn't make perfect sense immediately; you can
          adjust things later as you become more familiar with the envelope
          method of budgeting, and with your own spending patterns as you record
          them in DailyCashManager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the <em>Total to allocate</em> number at the top right of the
          wizard page. This represents the total amount of your wealth (assets
          minus liabilities), less the amount you have allocated to envelopes so
          far. This number will be reduced as you allocate more money to the
          envelopes. Any amount that you don't allocate will remain in the
          <em>Unallocated</em> envelope: this envelope is automatically created
          for you by DailyCashManager for just this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          After allocating what you think you need to your envelopes, if your
          <em>Unallocated</em> balance is a positive number, this means you have
          more money than you need to meet your immediate requirements. You might
          want to create a <em>pure envelope</em> called &quot;Retirement
          savings&quot; or &quot;Car savings&quot; or the like, to save for some
          longer term goal, and put your remaining unallocated funds into this
          (see <a href="#targetted-saving-using-pure-envelopes" class="js-ug-internal-link">Targetted saving using pure
          envelopes</a>). If you're not sure, you can leave these funds in
          <em>Unallocated</em> for now, and shift them elsewhere at a later time
          (see <a href="#transferring-money-between-envelopes"
          class="js-ug-internal-link">Transferring money between
          envelopes</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if <em>Unallocated</em> is negative (indicated by
          parentheses e.g. &quot;(100.00)&quot;), this suggests that you don't
          have sufficient net assets to cover your immediate expenditure
          requirements. See if you can realistically reduce some of your envelope
          allocations to bring <em>Unallocated</em> to nil. If you can't
          realistically do this, you can still leave the <em>Unallocated</em>
          negative; but try to aim over time to bring <em>Unallocated</em> up to
          <em>nil</em>. You can allocate regular funds into <em>Unallocated</em>
          by setting up a budget item in the <em>Unallocated</em> account editing
          panel (see <a href="#creating-and-editing-budget-items"
          class="js-ug-internal-link">Creating and editing budget
          items</a> for how to do this).

        Generally you will only want one DCM file to record all your transactions
        and budgets. In your first session, you will create your DCM file. In
        subsequent sessions, you will simply open your existing DCM file. There
        are several ways to open an existing DCM file:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Windows, double click directly on the DCM file.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Windows, double click the DailyCashManager icon in the Start Menu,
          then select <em>Open existing DailyCashManager file</em> and follow the
          prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Linux, type <code>dailycashmanager [FILE]</code> at the command line
          (where <code>[FILE]</code> is the path to your DCM file.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Linux, type <code>dailycashmanager</code> at the command line, select

<div id="accounts" class="js-ug-section js-ug-section-major">
  <h2 class="js-ug-section-major-title">Accounts</h2>
  <div class="js-ug-section-major-body">

    <p>
      An account represents either an amount of money that you &quot;own&quot;&mdash;
      such as a chequing account or savings account&mdash;or an amount that you
      &quot;owe&quot;&mdash;such as a credit card balance or loan. Managing your
      finances using DailyCashManager, you will keep track of the amount of money
      owned, or owing, in each account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you first set up your DailyCashManager file, you will want to create an
      account in the program for each account that you have in real life.
    </p>

    <div id="creating-an-account" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Creating an account</h3>
      <p>
        When you first set up your DCM file, you will create some accounts in the
        <em>setup wizard</em> to begin with. But if you want to create further
        accounts at a later time, it is easy to do so, as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create an account, click on <em>New</em> in the menu bar at the top,
        and select <em>New account</em> from the resulting menu. A small panel
        will appear near the centre of the screen. Enter the name of the account
        (e.g.  &quot;Cheque account&quot;, or &quot;Rewards saver&quot;, or
        &quot;XYZ Bank Credit card&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next row, select whether the account is an asset, or a liability.
        An asset represents wealth that you own, such as a bank account; whereas
        a liability is a debt, something you owe&mdash;for example, a credit card or
        loan. (But note if someone else owes <em>you</em> money, that counts as an
        asset.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Next enter a description for the new account in the <em>Description</em>
        box. For example, you might enter &quot;Savings account with XYZ Bank
        Pty Ltd&quot;. You can leave this blank if you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, enter the initial balance of the account in the <em>Initial
        balance</em> box. The initial balance is the balance of the account on
        the date shown in the panel, which is the same as the date you created
        your DCM file. If the account wasn't created in real life until after you
        set up the DCM file, then the initial balance should be left as zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if it's an asset account, then the initial balance (if it isn't
        zero), should generally be a positive number; if it's a liability, then
        this will generally be a negative number.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're done entering the details of the new account, click
        <em>Save</em>. The new account should then appear in the <em>Account</em>
        list at the left of the main window.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="editing-an-account" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Editing an account</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to edit the name, description or other properties of an
        account after you've created it, you can do so either by double-clicking
        on the account in the <em>Account</em> list on the left of the main
        window, or else by selecting the account and then selecting <em>Edit
        selected account</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu at the top. A panel
        will then appear in the centre of the screen. Change things as you see
        fit, then click <em>Save</em> to keep your changes, or <em>Cancel</em> to
        abort.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="hiding-an-account" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Hiding an account</h3>
      <p>
        By default, all accounts are shown in the <em>Account</em> list at the
        left of the main window. However, there may be times when you find you no
        longer need to use a particular account. To preserve the integrity of
        past transactions recorded in the DCM file, there is no way to delete an
        account once created; however you can hide an account from view, by
        opening the account editing panel (see <a href="#editing-an-account"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Editing an account</a>), and unchecking <em>Show in
        list</em>. Click <em>Save</em> to save the change, and the account will
        then disappear from the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you later decide you want to show the account, you can re-check the
        <em>Show in list</em> box, as follows. To edit the account given that it
        is currently hidden, you first need to select <em>Show hidden
        accounts</em> from the <em>View</em> menu at the top of the main window.
        This will cause all the hidden accounts to be displayed in the
        <em>Account</em> list. Double-click the account that you want to
        &quot;unhide&quot; to bring up the account editing panel; then click
        <em>Show in list</em>, and <em>Save</em>. Then open the <em>View</em>
        menu again, and select <em>Hide hidden accounts</em>. You will see that
        the account in question will still be visible, even though any other
        hidden accounts will again be hidden from view.

<div id="envelopes" class="js-ug-section js-ug-section-major">
  <h2 class="js-ug-section-major-title">Envelopes</h2>
  <div class="js-ug-section-major-body">
    <p>
      An envelope represents a category of expenditure or revenue. It is up to
      you to decide what envelopes you want to create in order to categorize your
      transactions, but you would typically create envelopes such as the
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical expenditure envelopes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Food</li>
      <li>Entertainment</li>
      <li>Holidays</li>
      <li>Electricity</li>
      <li>Bank fees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Typical revenue envelopes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Salary</li>
      <li>Interest received</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, DailyCashManager provides for a third category of envelope,
      called a <em>pure envelope</em>. A pure envelope is created in order to save
      for separately for some special or one-off item that is not covered by your
      day-to-day budgets; pure envelopes are discussed under
      <a href="#targetted-saving-using-pure-envelopes"
      class="js-ug-internal-link">Targetted saving using pure envelopes</a>.
    </p>

    <div id="creating-an-envelope" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Creating an envelope</h3>
      <p>
        To create an envelope, click on <em>New</em> in the menu bar at the top,
        and select <em>New envelope</em> from the resulting menu. A small panel
        will appear near the centre of the screen. Enter the name of the envelope
        (e.g.  &quot;Groceries&quot;, or &quot;Salary&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, in the <em>Envelope type</em> box, select whether the envelope is an
        expense, revenue or pure envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, you may want to enter a description in the <em>Description</em>
        box.  For example, if you had an &quot;Entertainment&quot; envelope, you
        might enter &quot;Spending on books, music and movies&quot; in the
        <em>Description</em> box. This field is optional, and is simply for your
        own future reference to clarify what kind of transactions will fall under
        this envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will see an <em>Initial allocation</em> box. This represents the
        initial amount that you want to make available for spending on this
        category, out of your initial net assets (the total of your assets minus
        liabilities), i.e.  your net assets when your DCM file is first created.
        For example, suppose that when you create your file, you have 100.00 in
        cash, 200.00 in your bank account, and a credit card balance of (50.00).
        Your initial total net assets are therefore 250.00 (100.00 + 200.00 -
        50.00). You might say that you want to allocate 50.00 of this 250.00
        towards &quot;Food&quot;, 100.00 towards &quot;Rent&quot;, and the
        remainder towards various other envelopes. You would then set the
        <em>Initial allocation</em> to &quot;Food&quot; as 50.00, and to
        &quot;Rent&quot; as 100.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, if you are creating an envelope some time after you have
        already set up your DCM file, you should leave the <em>Initial
        allocation</em> at zero.

        Click <em>Save</em> at the bottom right to save the newly created

      <h3>Editing an envelope</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to edit the name, description or other properties of an

        on the envelope where it appears in the <em>Envelope</em> list (near the
        centre of the main window), or else by selecting the envelope and then
        selecting <em>Edit selected envelope</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu at
        the top. A panel will then appear at the centre of the screen, showing

      <h3>Hiding an envelope</h3>
      <p>
        By default, all envelopes are shown in the <em>Envelope</em> list near
        the centre of the main window. However, there may be times when you
        find you no longer need to use a particular envelope. To preserve the
        integrity of the transactions already recorded in the DCM file, there
        is no way to delete an envelope once created; however you can always
        hide an envelope from view, by opening the envelope editing panel (see
        <a href="#editing-an-envelope" class="js-ug-internal-link">Editing an
        envelope</a>), and unchecking <em>Show in list</em>. The envelope will
        then disappear from the list.

      </p>
      <p>
        If you later decide you want to show the envelope, you can re-check the
        <em>Show in list</em> box, as follows. To edit the envelope given that is
        currently hidden, you will first need to select <em>Show hidden
        envelopes</em> from the <em>View</em> menu at the top of the main window.
        This will cause all hidden envelopes to be displayed in the
        <em>Envelope</em> list. Double-click the envelope that you want to
        &quot;unhide&quot; to bring up the envelope editing panel; then click
        <em>Show in list</em>, and <em>Save</em>. Then open the <em>View</em>
        menu again, and select <em>Hide hidden envelopes</em>. You will see that
        the envelope in question will still be visible, even though any other
        hidden envelopes will again be hidden from view.

      <h3>Entering a one-off transaction</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the time you will be entering a single transaction. This is a
        matter of entering the transaction details in the <em>transaction
        panel</em>. The <em>transaction panel</em> is the large area at the top
        right of the main window. (This is distinct from the
        <em>Transactions</em> tab at the top left.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This is best illustrated using examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 1&mdash;you spend 30.95 from your credit card on a meal at a
        restaurant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select <em>Spend</em> from the transaction type box at the top left of
          the transaction panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter &quot;30.95&quot; into the amount box at the top right of the
          transaction panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, select your credit card account from box labelled
          <em>Account</em>. Enter an optional memo in the row next to the
          <em>Account</em> box. For example, you might enter the name of the
          restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select &quot;Food&quot; from the box labelled <em>Envelope</em>. Enter
          an optional memo, e.g. &quot;dinner at restaurant&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, there should be a box containing the text, &quot;Record
          once only, on&quot;. This means you are entering a single, one-off
          transaction. Leave this as is.
        </li>
        <li>
          There should be a box near the bottom right of the transaction panel,
          containing today's date. If you are entering the transaction on the same
          day the the transaction occurred (generally a good idea), you can leave
          this as is; otherwise, manually enter the date the transaction actually
          occurred in this box.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the bottom right of the transaction panel, click <em>Save</em> to
          confirm and save the transaction; or click <em>Clear</em> if you want to
          abandon this transaction entry and start again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example 2&mdash;you earn 2000.00 in wages, deposited into your &quot;XYZ Bank

      <ul>
        <li>
          Select <em>Earn</em> from the transaction type box at the top left of
          the transaction panel.

        <li>
          Enter &quot;2000&quot; into the amount box at the top right of the
          transaction panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, select &quot;XYZ Bank savings&quot; from the box
          labelled <em>Account</em>. Enter an optional memo in the row next to
          the <em>Account</em> box. For example, you might enter the name of your
          employer.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, select &quot;Salary&quot; from the box labelled

          number, for example; or you might simply leave this blank.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, there should be a box containing the text, &quot;Record

          There should be a box near the bottom right of the transaction panel,

          occurred in this box.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the bottom right of the transaction panel, click <em>Save</em> to
          confirm and save the transaction; or click <em>Clear</em> if you want to
          abandon this transaction entry and start again.

      <p>
        Example 3&mdash;you withdraw 100.00 in cash from your &quot;XYZ Bank
        savings&quot; account:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select <em>Account transfer</em> from the transaction type box at the
          top left of the transaction panel.

        <li>
          Enter &quot;100&quot; into the amount box at the top right of the
          transaction panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, select &quot;XYZ Bank savings&quot; from the box
          labelled <em>Source</em>. Enter an optional memo in the row next to the
          <em>Source</em> box (for example, you might enter &quot;withdraw cash
          at bank ATM&quot;).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next row, select &quot;Cash&quot; from the box labelled
          <em>Destination</em>. Enter an optional memo.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select &quot;Record once only, on&quot;, enter the date and click
          <em>Save</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that when entering the date of a one-off transaction, you can enter
        a past date, leave it as today's date, or enter a future date.
        Regardless of what date you enter (even if you enter a future date),
        the corresponding account and envelope balances will be update
        immediately.  (This is unlike a recurring transaction, which is not
        actually recorded until the &quot;Next date&quot; is reached&mdash;see
        <a href="#recurring-transactions" class="js-ug-internal-link">Recurring

        <p>
          In addition to the transaction types <em>Spend</em>, <em>Earn</em> and
          <em>Account transfer</em>, there is a fourth transaction type,
          <em>Generic</em>. You might never feel the need to use this category;
          and if you don't that's fine. It is provided to enable you to enter
          complicated transactions that don't fit neatly into any of the other
          categories. When you select the <em>Generic</em> transaction type, you
          will notice that the account and envelope selection boxes are labelled
          <em>CR</em> and <em>DR</em>. These refer to the concept of accounting
          credits and debits. You will also notice that both for the <em>CR</em>
          and the <em>DR</em> row, you can select <em>any</em> account or
          envelope (other than pure envelopes) in either row. You can think of
          the <em>CR</em> row is the equivalent of the &quot;source&quot; row&mdash;
          and the <em>DR</em> row as the &quot;destination&quot; row. An example
          will help to clarify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you withdraw 200.00 from your &quot;XYZ Bank savings&quot;
          account using an automatic teller machine (ATM), and in the process of
          doing so, you incur a 2.00 transaction fee. This transaction has
          characteristics both of an <em>Account transfer</em> transaction (since
          you are transferring money from your bank account to the
          &quot;Cash&quot; account) and of a <em>Spend</em> transaction (since
          you are spending 2.00 on the transaction fee). If you wanted to, you
          could break this down into two separate transactions, and enter these
          separately (the 200.00 transfer, and the 2.00 expenditure on bank
          fees). However, there is faster way of entering this transaction, using
          the <em>Generic</em> transaction type, as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select <em>Generic</em> from the transaction type box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter &quot;202&quot; in the amount box at the top right. This
            corresponds to the total amount deducted from your bank account in
            the course of this transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the <em>CR</em> box, select &quot;XYZ Bank savings&quot;.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the second row, select &quot;Cash&quot;, then click the
            <em>Split</em> button to the right (see <a href="#split-transactions"
            class="js-ug-internal-link">Split transactions</a> for more explanation on
            this).
          </li>
          <li>
            There will now be two rows in the bottom half of the transaction
            control, both with &quot;Cash&quot; showing in the <em>DR</em> box.
            In the first of these rows, enter &quot;200&quot; in the amount box,
            representing the 200.00 cash you physically withdrew from the ATM.
            Leave this first row as &quot;Cash&quot;. Then in the bottom row,
            select &quot;Bank fees&quot; from the <em>DR</em> box, and enter
            &quot;2&quot; in the amount box to the right. If you can like you can
            enter text into the <em>Memo</em> boxes.  E.g., you might enter
            &quot;ATM fee&quot; in the very bottom row, and &quot;ATM
            withdrawal&quot; in the middle row.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter the date and click <em>Save</em>, as usual.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Generic transactions can save a bit of time, but if you don't feel like
          using this feature, there is no need to do so; just split any
          complicated transactions like this into their component parts, and
          enter these separately.

    <div id="recurring-transactions" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Recurring transactions</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes you will have a certain transaction that occurs again and
        again, with the same amount, at set intervals. For example, you might get
        paid a 1000.00 wage every 2 weeks; or you might have 250.00 in rent
        deducted from you bank account every week. It would be tedious to have to
        remember to enter these transactions manually every time they occur. To
        avoid this tedium, DailyCashManager supports the concept of recurring
        transactions. You only have to enter a recurring transaction once, and
        DailyCashManager will automatically record the transaction for you at the
        appropriate intervals thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a recurring transaction, begin by entering the transaction as
        you normally would. For example, for the 250.00 weekly rent payment, you
        would select the <em>Spend</em> transaction type, enter &quot;250&quot;
        in the amount box, select your bank account from the <em>Account</em>
        box, and select &quot;Rent&quot; from the <em>Envelope</em> box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before hitting <em>Save</em>, however, you need to select the recurring
        transaction interval from the large box near the bottom left of the
        transaction panel (the one that normally reads &quot;Record once only,
        on&quot;). In this case, you would select &quot;Record every week,
        starting&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, in the date box near the bottom right, enter the date when the
        recurring transaction will <em>next</em> occur. Hit <em>Save</em> as
        usual to save the transaction. You will be prompted to enter a unique
        name for the recurring transaction. You might simply enter &quot;Rent
        payment&quot; here; it's up to you what you enter&mdash;this is just so that
        you can easily identify the transaction later on. Click <em>OK</em> to
        confirm. You will notice that your new recurring transaction is now
        recorded in the <em>Recurring transaction</em> list at the bottom right
        of the main window, with the date you entered recorded in the <em>Next
        date</em> column.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time you open your DCM file <em>on or after</em> the <em>Next
        date</em> for this transaction, you will find that DailyCashManager has
        automatically recorded this transaction for you; a message box will
        appear at that time, informing you that the transaction has been
        recorded. The transaction will continue to be recorded automatically at
        the intervals you specify, until you delete it (or edit it to record at
        some other interval).

        <h4>
          Setting a recurring transaction to record on the last day of the month
        </h4>
        <p>
          To avoid confusion, DailyCashManager has two different types of
          &quot;monthly&quot; frequencies. Normally if you want a transaction to
          be recorded every month (or every 2 months or etc.), you would select
          &quot;Record every month, starting&quot; (or &quot;Record every 2
          months, starting&quot;, or etc.) from the frequency selection list.
          However, suppose you want to record a transaction on the <em>last</em>
          day of every month.  Suppose the next date that you want the
          transaction to be recorded on is 30 April 2014, say. If you were simply
          to specify that you wanted this transaction to be recorded every month,
          this would entail that you want it to be recorded on the <em>30th</em>
          of each month; but that's not want you want at all; because the last
          day of May, for example, is the 31st, not the 30th.  To avoid this
          confusion, DailyCashManager prevents you from entering a simple
          &quot;every month&quot; transaction with the 29th, 30th or 31st as the
          next recording date. If you want a transaction to be recorded on the
          last day of each month (which might be the 30th, 31st, 28th or 29th,
          depending on the month in question), select &quot;Record every month,
          on the last day of the month, starting&quot; from the frequency box,
          and this will have the desired effect.

      <h3>Viewing or editing a transaction</h3>
      <p>
        You can view or edit a transaction after you have already saved it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First you need to select the transaction you want to view or edit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To select a one-off transaction for editing, click the
          <em>Transactions</em> tab near the top left of the main window (between
          the <em>Balances</em> and <em>Reconciliations</em> tabs). From the
          <em>Account or envelope</em> box, select one of the accounts or
          envelopes you know was involved in the transaction you are interested
          in. Then enter a date range in the <em>From</em> and <em>To</em> boxes
          (you can make these blank to view all transactions regardless of
          date). Then click <em>Run</em>. A list of transactions, involving the
          selected account or envelope, will be displayed in the large panel
          below. Locate the transaction you want to edit in this list. You can
          view this transaction either by double-clicking it, or else by
          selecting it and then choosing <em>Edit selected ordinary
          transaction</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu. This will cause the full
          detail of the selected transaction to appear in the transaction panel
          to the right.
        </li>
        <li>
          To view or edit a recurring transaction, locate it in the <em>Recurring
          transaction</em> list at the bottom right of the main window. Either
          double-click it, or else select it and then choose <em>Edit selected
          recurring transaction</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu. This will cause
          the full detail of the selected transaction to appear in the
          transaction panel above.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the desired transaction is selected and appears in the transaction
        panel, you can edit if desired. Simply change the contents of the date,
        amount, <em>Account</em>, <em>Memo</em> and other boxes as desired; then
        click <em>Save</em> to save your changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To preserve the integrity of your DCM file, there are certain aspects of
        the transaction you won't be able edit; for example, you can't change a
        <em>Spend</em> transaction to an <em>Earn</em> transaction. Also, if some
        or all lines in the transaction have been reconciled (see <a href="#reconciliations"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Reconciliations</a>), those lines, as well as some
        other aspects of the transaction such as the date, will be greyed out and
        will impossible to edit. This is to preserve the integrity of the
        reconciliation.  (Don't worry if you don't know what that means right
        now.) Most aspects of the transaction can be edited however.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to abandon your changes and revert to the earlier saved
        version of the transaction, just click <em>Cancel</em> (near the bottom
        left of the transaction panel, above the <em>Delete transaction</em>
        button). This will cause the transaction panel to return to its default
        blank state, ready for a new transaction to be entered. (The transaction
        you had selected for editing will still be there in your DCM file,
        unchanged, in the same state it was in when you selected it; but it will
        no longer be showing in the transaction panel.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if you edit a recurring transaction, it won't cause any changes
        to the individual instances of that recurring transaction that have
        already been recorded; it will change only the behaviour of that
        recurring transaction from that point on.

    <div id="deleting-a-transaction" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Deleting a transaction</h3>
      <p>
        To delete a transaction entirely, whether a one-off transaction or a
        recurring transaction, first select the transaction for editing as
        explained under <a href="#viewing-or-editing-a-transaction"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Viewing or editing a
        transaction</a> above. Then, click the <em>Delete transaction</em> button
        at the bottom right of the transaction panel. A message box will appear
        asking if you are sure you want to delete the entire transaction. Click
        <em>Yes</em> to confirm deletion, or <em>No</em> to abort the deletion
        and be returned to the transaction panel.  Once the transaction is
        deleted, account and envelope balances will be updated accordingly: the
        balances will be as if the deleted transaction had never been recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that deleting a recurring transaction does not delete any individual
        instances of that transaction that have already been recorded. That is,
        while past &quot;recordings&quot; of the transaction will remain as is,
        the recurring transaction itself will be deleted, and further
        &quot;recordings&quot; of the transaction will no longer be generated.

    </div>

    <div id="split-transactions" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Split transactions</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes you will need to record a transaction one &quot;side&quot; of
        which involves multiple accounts or envelopes. For example, suppose you
        spend 100.00 at a department store in a single transaction, but 10.00 of
        the 100.00 is spent on food and the other 90.00 is spent on clothes. You
        can reflect this using the <em>split transaction</em> feature. Click the
        <em>Split</em> button, at the right of the row in the transaction that
        you want to split, and that row will be split into two. In this example,
        you would split the <em>Envelope</em> side of the transaction into two
        rows, one for your &quot;Food&quot; envelope, and the other for your
        &quot;Clothing&quot; envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can split a transaction into even more rows by clicking <em>Split</em>
        again; or if you change your mind, you can remove the last row by clicking
        <em>Unsplit</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If required, both sides of a transaction can be split. Continuing with
        our example, you might pay for 40.00 of the 100.00 at the department
        store using cash, and the remaining 60.00 using your credit card. In this
        case, you would split the <em>Account</em> side of the transaction into
        two rows, one for your &quot;Cash&quot; account and the other for your
        &quot;Credit card&quot; account, as well as splitting the
        <em>Envelope</em> side into &quot;Food&quot; and &quot;Clothing&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a given side of a transaction is split, a separate amount box
        becomes available for each row in the split. The amounts entered in the
        rows for that side need to sum to the same amount as the total
        transaction amount entered at the top of the transaction panel (so, in
        our example, they would need to sum to 100.00). You can enter the amount
        in each amount box manually; however, you will see below, under <a
        href="#handy-shortcuts" class="js-ug-internal-link">Handy shortcuts</a>, that
        there are often faster ways to populate the amount boxes, than entering
        the number manually.

          Suppose you have entered &quot;100.52&quot; in the main amount box of
          the transaction panel, for some <em>Expense</em> transaction. You then
          split the <em>Envelope</em> row into two, and select &quot;Food&quot;
          for one row and &quot;Household supplies&quot; for the other row. Say
          you spent 80.53 on food, and the remainder, 19.99, on household
          supplies. You enter &quot;80.53&quot; in the &quot;Food&quot; row. Now,
          you could enter &quot;19.99&quot; manually in the &quot;Household
          supplies&quot; row. But calculating this number may involve adding
          several items from your receipt, or else performing a calculation
          (100.52 - 80.53 = 19.99) to work out how much you spent on household
          supplies. To avoid the bother of performing a manual calculation, you
          can simply double-click in the amount box of the &quot;Household
          supplies&quot; row, and DailyCashManager will calculate the 19.99 for
          you, and populate the cell with this figure.

          In general, whenever you have a split transaction, and you want to
          populate one of the amount cells with whatever is the
          &quot;remaining&quot; amount of the total transaction amount that has
          not yet been entered, simply double-click on the cell you want to
          populate, and the remaining amount will be calculated and inserted into
          the cell automatically.

        <h4>Performing simple calculations within an amount cell</h4>
        <p>
          DailyCashManager can act as a primitive calculator. Suppose you spent
          100.52 at the supermarket, but your receipt includes many items, some
          of which fall under &quot;Food&quot;, and others of which fall under
          &quot;Household supplies&quot;. You could create a split transaction
          with a separate row for every single item on the receipt; but this
          would be cumbersome and laborious.  Instead, you might enter all the
          &quot;Food&quot; items in one row, and all the &quot;Household
          supplies&quot; items in another row. But to do this you need to add up
          the cost of all the food items. Instead of getting out a calculator,
          you can add the cost of the food items directly, within the amount box
          for the &quot;Food&quot; row. Suppose there are three food items,
          costing 1.52, 19.89 and 5.03. Simply type &quot;1.52+19.89+5.03&quot;
          into the amount cell for this row, then hit tab or click outside the
          cell. Then the result, &quot;26.44&quot;, will automatically appear in
          the cell. You can also perform subtractions, e.g. by typing
          &quot;80.89-38.60&quot; in the cell. Note, however, that you can't do
          multiplication or division, and you can't use parentheses in
          calculations.

      If you want to, you can use DailyCashManager simply as a means of recording
      your financial transactions as they occur, keeping track of your asset and
      liability balances, your earnings, and the amounts spent on different
      expense categories. If you use DailyCashManager in this way, you will build
      up a record of <em>historical</em> financial data. It can be quite useful
      to have this record; but it will be purely &quot;backward-looking&quot;. To
      really manage your finances effectively, you'll want to know not only how
      much money you <em>have</em> spent on one category or another, but also,
      how much you <em>can</em> spend on one category or another, if you want to
      meet your financial goals. That is, you'll want to use DailyCashManager not
      only as a historical record, but also as a planning mechanism, a mechanism
      for taking <em>control</em> of your spending so that you can reach your
      financial goals.
    </p>

    <div id="envelope-budgeting" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Envelope budgeting</h3>
      <p>
        To facilitate this planning and control function, DailyCashManager
        implements a system known as <em>envelope budgeting</em>. Envelope
        budgeting is a well-tried financial strategy that involves allocating
        your money, as you earn it, into different &quot;envelopes&quot;, to save
        for different categories of expenditure. Traditional envelope budgeting
        would involve physically placing cash into physical envelopes out of your
        paycheck each time you were paid. If you knew you spent on average
        1000.00 a year, say, on electricity bills, and if you were paid monthly,
        you would have put 83.33 per month into the &quot;Electricity&quot;
        envelope. Then when the electicity bill arrived, there would be a lump of
        money sitting in the electricity envelope, set aside just for the purpose
        of paying the electricity bill. You would remove the amount of the bill
        from the electricity envelope, and pay the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, most people don't get paid in physical cash; we keep most of
        our money in bank accounts, shares, term deposits or other assets; and
        many people have credit cards, loans and other liabilities offsetting
        those assets. These accounts are digital in nature; and so the crude
        method of dividing physical cash into different envelopes is awkward or
        impossible to apply. That's where an application like DailyCashManager
        comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of physical envelopes, DailyCashManager facilitates the creation
        of &quot;virtual&quot; envelopes, each envelope representing a different
        category of revenue or expenditure. And instead of allocating a blob of
        cash into each envelope with each paycheck, DailyCashManager allocates a
        small, steady amount of money to each envelope, on a <em>daily</em>
        basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you receive 1000.00 cash, paid into your &quot;XYZ Bank
        saving&quot; bank account. You would enter a revenue transaction in
        DailyCashManager, with &quot;XYZ Bank saving&quot; as the account, and
        &quot;Salary&quot; as the envelope. The balance of &quot;XYZ Bank
        saving&quot; would increase by 1000.00, and the balance of the
        &quot;Salary&quot; envelope would also increase by 1000.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each day thereafter&mdash;depending on how you have set up your <em>budget
        items</em> (explained below)&mdash;a small amount of that 1000.00 would be
        transferred automatically by DailyCashManager from the &quot;Salary&quot;
        envelope, into each of your expense envelopes, to set aside towards each
        category of expenditure. Let's now see how to set up your <em>budget
        items</em> to make this happen.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="creating-and-editing-budget-items" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Creating and editing budget items</h3>
      <p>
        A <em>budget item</em> represents a given expense or revenue item for
        which you want to set aside money in an envelope. Often you will need to
        create only a single budget item for a given envelope; but you can create
        multiple budget items for a single envelope if you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might have an expense envelope called &quot;Bank
        fees&quot;.  Within this envelope, you might record two different ongoing
        fees: a 2.00 monthly account fee; a 50.45 annual credit card fee. You
        would create one budget item for the monthly account fee, and another
        budget item for the credit card fee. You would do this as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open the envelope editing panel for &quot;Bank fees&quot;, either by
          double-clicking &quot;Bank fees&quot; in the <em>Envelope</em> list, or
          by selecting &quot;Bank fees&quot; in the <em>Envelope</em> list and
          then selecting <em>Edit selected envelope</em> form the <em>Edit</em>
          menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Within the envelope editing panel, click <em>Add item</em>. A new row
          will appear under <em>BUDGET ITEMS</em>. Enter &quot;Monthly account
          fee&quot; in the <em>Description</em> box and &quot;2&quot; in the
          <em>Amount</em> box, and select &quot;per month&quot; from the
          <em>Frequency</em> box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click <em>Add item</em> again. This will produce another row of boxes.
          Enter &quot;Credit card fee&quot; in the <em>Description</em> box and
          &quot;50.45&quot; in the <em>Amount</em> box, and select &quot;per 12
          months&quot; from the <em>Frequency</em> box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notice that just above the words &quot;BUDGET ITEMS&quot;, the
          <em>Daily top up</em> amount will read &quot;0.20&quot;. This means
          that, in order to set aside enough money to cover the two budget items
          you have entered, DailyCashManager will automatically transfer an
          amount of 0.20 into the &quot;Bank account&quot; envelope every day.
          This is calculated as follows: (2 * 12) + 50.45 / 365.25 = 0.20.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click <em>Save</em>. Another window will now appear informing you that
          the &quot;Budget is now out of balance by an amount of (0.20).&quot;
          This is saying that, in order to transfer the 0.20 into the &quot;Bank
          fees&quot; envelope each day, DailyCashManager needs transfer that 0.20
          <em>from</em> some other envelope into &quot;Bank fees&quot;. By
          default&mdash;and if you click <em>Leave unbalanced</em> this deafult will
          be unchanged&mdash;the 0.20 is transferred from the envelope called
          &quot;Unallocated&quot;. This is an envelope that DailyCashManager
          creates automatically to process unbalanced budget amounts. You
          <em>don't</em> normally want &quot;Unallocated&quot; to have a balance
          other than zero. Instead of clicking &quot;Leave unbalanced&quot;, you
          should select some other envelope to draw the 0.20 / day from&mdash;by
          selecting from the drop-down list at the bottom of this panel&mdash;and
          then click <em>Offset to envelope below</em>. Commonly, you would
          offset the 0.20 / day to your &quot;Salary&quot; envelope (or whatever
          is your main source of ongoing income, e.g. &quot;Pension&quot;,
          &quot;Allowance&quot; or etc..). This means that every day, 0.20 will
          be transferred from your &quot;Salary&quot; envelope to your &quot;Bank
          fees&quot; envelope, to provide for both your monthly account fee and
          your annual credit card fee. After clicking <em>Save</em>, the
          envelope editing panel will disappear. Notice that in the
          <em>Envelope</em> list near the centre of the main window, there will
          be a &quot;0.20&quot; in the <em>Daily top-up</em> column, next to
          &quot;Bank fees&quot;.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="living-within-your-means" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Living within your means</h3>
      <p>
        In DailyCashManager, the amount in an expense envelope at a given point
        in time represents the amount that is available to spend on that category
        of expenditure at that time. Budgeting using the DailyCashManager
        envelope system means trying not to spend any more on each expenditure
        category than what is available in the corresponding envelope at a given
        point in time. You can think of an envelope in DCM as just the electronic
        equivalent of physical cash in a physical envelope: if the money isn't
        there to spend, you can't (or rather shouldn't) spend it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, of course, reality asserts itself, and you may have no
        realistic choice but to spend more than what's in a given envelope for a
        given expenditure category. If this happens, you should still enter the
        transaction as usual; and this will cause the envelope balance to become
        negative.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="responding-to-a-negative-envelope-balance" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Responding to a negative envelope balance</h3>
      <p>
        If the balance in an envelope becomes negative, it usually makes sense,
        first of all, to examine the budget items for that envelope, and
        realistically ask yourself whether they are set at adequate levels. There
        may simply not be enough allocated to some budget item; or perhaps you
        should create an additional budget item to cover off some item of
        expenditure that you hadn't considered previously. To get some idea of
        whether your ongoing budget item allocations are realistic, you might
        want to run an <a href="#income-and-expenditure"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Income and expenditure</a>
        report and look at the average daily expenditure for the relevant
        envelope for, say, the last 6 or 12 months (or whatever time period you
        have available), and compare this to the daily allocation for that
        envelope that is being generated by your budget items.  (Depending on the
        time period, you might want to allow for inflation when making this
        comparison.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, if the envelope hasn't gone <em>too</em> far into a negative
        balance, the best response is simply to wait: continue on, trying if
        possible not to spend any more from the envelope with the negative
        balance until it has become positive, and then restricting one's
        expenditure on that category to whatever positive balance is available in
        that envelope thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a <em>large</em> negative balance, however, you might want to
        look for another envelope in which you have excess funds&mdash;funds which
        you don't realistically think you will require for that other category of
        expenditure&mdash;and transfer some of those excess funds into the negative
        envelope, if possible restoring the latter to a positive balance. We
        discuss this next.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="transferring-money-between-envelopes" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Transferring money between envelopes</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes you find that one envelope contains more than excess funds,
        while another contains a shortfall. If this occurs, you should review the
        budget items in each envelope to see whether the ongoing daily
        allocations to each are adequate, or inadequate, and edit these as
        required. However, as a one-off measure, you can reallocate funds from
        one envelope to another. This should be done sparingly&mdash;after all, if
        you always shift money around to wherever you want it whenever you want
        it, you will defeat the purpose of envelope budgeting entirely&mdash;but
        sometimes it does make sense to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        To shift money between envelopes, select <em>New envelope transfer</em>
        from the <em>New</em> menu at the top of the main window. Enter the
        amount you want to transfer; select the envelope to transfer
        <em>from</em> in the <em>Source</em> box; and select the envelope you
        want to transfer the funds into, from the <em>Destination</em> box. Then
        click <em>OK</em> to proceed with the transfer, or <em>Cancel</em> to
        abort.
      </p>
      <p>
        On returning to the main window, you will notice that the balances of the
        affected envelopes have been updated accordingly.

    <div id="targetted-saving-using-pure-envelopes" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Targetted saving using pure envelopes</h3>
      <p>
        Usually when you create an envelope, it will be either a <em>revenue</em>
        or an <em>expense</em> envelope. However, DailyCashManager provides for a
        third kind of envelope, called a <em>pure envelope</em>. A pure envelope
        is one for which it is not possible to record any <em>actual</em>
        transactions. Rather, you use it to accumulate funds towards some special
        goal or other, and then when the money is required to be spent on that
        goal, you transfer it out of the pure envelope, and into an ordinary
        expense envelope, and spend it from the expense envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might know that, on average, you spend 100.00 on food
        during the week leading up to Christmas, over and above your usual weekly
        spending on food. Accordingly, you could create a pure envelope called
        &quot;Christmas food fund&quot;. You would create this in the same way as
        you would create any other envelope (see <a href="#creating-an-envelope"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Creating an envelope</a>), except that in the
        envelope creation panel, instead of selecting <em>revenue</em> or
        <em>expense</em> from the <em>envelope type</em> box, you would select
        <em>pure envelope</em>.  You would then create a budget item under this
        envelope (see <a href="#creating-and-editing-budget-items"
        class="js-ug-internal-link">Creating and editing budget
        items</a>), for allocating 100.00 per twelve months towards Christmas
        food expenditure. Then, when the week leading up to Christmas comes round
        (assuming you created this budget item one year before), you would
        transfer 100.00 out of the &quot;Christmas food fund&quot; pure envelope,
        and into your usual &quot;Food&quot; expense envelope, and spend it out
        of &quot;Food&quot;.

      One of the benefits of using DailyCashManager is that you can see, at a
      glance, the balances of your various bank accounts and credit cards,
      without having to check with your bank. However, it is still important to
      make sure that the record of account balances in your DCM file aligns with
      the record that is being maintained by your bank. It is always possible
      that errors will be made when entering transactions into DailyCashManager;
      or that you might occasionally forget to enter a transaction. Therefore, it
      is important to check occasionally, that your record of account balances
      matches the record that is being kept by your bank, credit card companies
      or etc..
    </p>

    <div id="simple-approach" class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Simple approach</h3>
      <p>
        One simple way to check that your records are accurate for a given
        account is simply to check occasionally the balance kept by the bank, and
        compare it to the balance of that account in DailyCashManager. If they
        are the same, then the balance in DailyCashManager is presumably
        accurate. However, this simple check is sometimes not as straightforward
        as might be expected. For example, suppose the account in question is
        your credit card account. You might make a purchase of 30.00 on 1st July.
        You enter this in your DCM file, and your credit card balance decreases
        by 30.00. However as there is often a delay in processing credit card
        transaction through to your credit card account, the 30.00 is not
        deducted from your credit card at the bank's end until 3rd July.  If, on
        2nd July, you were to compare the balance in your DCM file with the
        balance as it appear in the bank's record of your credit card account,
        these two amounts would differ by 30.00&mdash;even though the record in your
        DCM file is correct and accurate.

    <div id="using-dailycashmanager-to-perform-reconciliations"
      class="js-ug-section">
      <h3>Using DailyCashManager to perform reconciliations</h3>
      <p>
        To avoid the confusion that can arise from adopting the simple approach
        described above, it is recommended to use the <em>Reconciliations</em>
        facility provided by DailyCashManager, to ensure the balances in your DCM
        file stay in line with those recorded by your bank or other financial
        institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most straightforward way to do this is, first of all, to make sure,
        for every account that you hold with a financial institution, that you
        are receiving account statements from that institution on a regular
        basis. Then, each time you receive a statement for that account, open
        your DCM file, and perform a <em>reconciliation</em> for that statement,
        as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have a pen and your bank statement handy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the <em>Reconciliations</em> tab, which is third tab from the
          left, near the top left of the main window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the account that you are reconciling, from the <em>Account</em>
          box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter the opening date of the bank statement in the <em>From</em> box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter the closing date of the bank statement in the <em>To</em> box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click <em>Run</em>. A list of transactions will be displayed. The list
          will show all transactions from the <em>To</em> date to the
          <em>From</em> date, inclusive, for the selected account. In addition,
          the list will show any transactions on this account <em>before</em> the
          <em>From</em> date, that have not yet been &quot;reconciled&quot;. A
          transaction is regarded &quot;reconciled&quot; when you have confirmed
          that it is correct, and that the amount of the transaction matches the
          amount shown on your bank statement for that transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the list, the <em>Date</em>, <em>Memo</em> and <em>Amount</em> of
          each transaction are shown. In addition, you will notice a
          <em>Reconciled</em> column. For transactions that have not been
          reconciled, this column will be blank; once a transaction has been
          reconciled, the transaction amount will appear in the
          <em>Reconciled</em> column.
        </li>
        <li>
          Near the top of the report, you will see a <em>Closing balance</em>
          figure.  This is the balance as recorded in your DCM file, as at the
          date you entered in the <em>To</em> box (the bank statement closing
          date). You will also see a <em>Reconciled balance</em> number. This is
          the total of the <em>reconciled</em> transactions up to and including
          the <em>To</em> date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, look at each transaction in your bank statement in turn. Look for
          that same transaction in the <em>Reconciliations</em> list:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the transaction amount in your bank statement matches the
              transaction amount in DailyCashManager&mdash;and you're satisfied that
              the other details of the transaction are correct&mdash;then you can
              mark that transaction as reconciled: physically tick it off with
              pen on your bank statement; and <em>right-mouse-click</em> on the
              transaction in the <em>Reconciliations</em> panel. This will cause
              the <em>Reconciled</em> column to be populated with the amount for
              that transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the transaction amounts do not match, then, assuming you are
              satisfied that the amount on your bank statement is correct, you
              can edit the transaction in DailyCashManager by double-clicking it
              in the <em>Reconciliations</em> list. This will bring the
              transaction up in the transaction panel, where you can edit it as
              described in <a href="#viewing-or-editing-a-transaction"
              class="js-ug-internal-link">Viewing or editing a
              transaction</a>. Once you have edited the amount so that it matches
              the amount shown in the bank statement, click <em>Save</em>, and
              the <em>Reconcilations</em> list will be automatically updated with
              the revised amount. Assuming this now matches, you can now tick off
              the transaction and mark it as reconciled by
              <em>right-mouse-clicking</em> on it; remember to tick it off on
              your physical bank statement as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the transaction on your bank statement does not appear in the
              <em>Reconciliations</em> list in DailyCashManager, then it may be
              because it is a bank fee or interest&mdash;as you might not otherwise
              be made aware of these until you actually receive the bank
              statement.  During the reconciliation process, you can enter newly
              discoved transactions&mdash;or transactions you simply forgot to enter
              at the time&mdash;as you normally would (see
              <a href="#entering-a-one-off-transaction"
              class="js-ug-internal-link">Entering a one-off transaction</a>); once
              saved, the new transaction will appear in the
              <em>Reconciliations</em> list, where you can then mark it as
              reconciled as by <em>right-mouse-clicking</em> on it; remember to
              tick it off on your physical bank statement as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have worked through each of the transactions on your bank
          statement, you may find that there are transactions in the
          <em>Reconciliations</em> list that have still not been marked as
          reconciled. This is often because of a delay in bank or credit card
          processing. If the transaction in question is near the <em>To</em> date
          (the closing date on the statement), this is to be expected. Just leave
          it until you get the next statement&mdash;you can reconcile it then, since
          unreconciled transactions will continue to show up in the
          <em>Reconciliations</em> list until they are reconciled. Otherwise, if
          it appears that the transaction is simply missing from the bank
          statement and it's not just a timing issue, it might be because you
          entered in the wrong account by mistake when you originally recorded it
          in DailyCashManager. You can always double-click the
          &quot;offending&quot; transaction and edit it, as normal, in the
          transaction panel (see <a href="#viewing-or-editing-a-transaction"
          class="js-ug-internal-link">Viewing or
          editing a transaction</a>).  Once you have saved your edits, if you
          have changed the account for the transaction, it will disappear from
          the <em>Reconciliations</em> list for that account automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having dealt with all the transactions in the bank statement and
          <em>Reconciliations</em> list as described above, all the transactions
          in your bank statement (or credit card statement or etc.) should now be
          ticked off, and the <em>Reconciled balance</em> figure (near the top of
          the list) should now be equal to the closing balance shown on your bank
          statement. If it is, then the reconciliation is complete; you can
          simply close out of DailyCashManager, or else just continue browsing or
          working in DailyCashManager as you see fit. If the <em>Reconciled
          balance</em> is not equal to the closing balance on your bank
          statement, then double check that the transactions you ticked match the
          ones you marked as reconciled in the <em>Reconciliations</em> list&mdash;
          once they are equal, the amounts should match.

        see this report, click on the <em>Reports</em> tab, which is near the top
        left of the main window. Select <em>Balance sheet</em> from the
        <em>Report type</em> box (if it is not already selected). Enter the date
        range you are interested in in the <em>From</em> and <em>To</em> boxes.
        By default, these will be set to show the last seven days. Click the
        <em>Run</em> button to run the report for the first time; this button
        will appear as <em>Refresh</em>, if there is already a report showing
        in this panel, in which case you should click <em>Refresh</em> to make
        sure the report is current. The report will appear in the panel below.
        The <em>Opening balance</em> column shows the balance of each account
        as at the start of the date in the <em>From</em> box; and the
        <em>Closing balance</em> column shows the balance as at the end of the
        date entered in the <em>To</em> box. The <em>Movement</em> column shows
        the increase or decrease in the account balance during this period of
        time. Accounts for which the opening balance, closing balance and
        movement are all nil, are not shown in the report. Note liabilities
        normally have a negative balance (surrounded by brackets) and assets
        normally have a positive balance.

        You also have the option of leaving the <em>From</em> and/or the

        this report. If you leave the <em>To</em> box blank, then all
        transactions from the <em>From</em> date onwards are included in the
        figures shown; however, the <em>Daily average</em> column will now show
        &quot;N/A&quot;, as the possibility of future-dated transactions being

        Note that the <em>Income and expenditure</em> report will not be
