Getting started
===============

Running DailyCashManager for the first time
-------------------------------------------

*On Windows*

Double-click the DailyCashManager icon in the Start menu.

*On Linux*

Enter ``dailycashmanager`` at the command line.

Creating a DailyCashManager file
--------------------------------

When you first run DCM, the application needs to create a file in which to
store your data. A small panel will be displayed on startup, titled,
"Welcome to DailyCashManager!"

Click on *Create a new DailyCashManager file* and the *DailyCashManager Setup
Wizard* will guide through the process of setting up your DCM file.

File name, location and currency
................................

The first page of the wizard will ask you to select a location where you would
like to save DCM file. Click the *Browse...* button to browse your filesystem
and select a suitable location. It doesn't matter much where you save the file,
as long as you can easily remember where you saved it. By default, the new file
will be saved in your home folder; if you're happy for it to be saved here, you
can just leave this option unchanged.

Next, enter a name for the new file. This defaults to your user name, but you
can enter any other name you choose, providing it is a valid filename on your
system. The ".dcm" extension will be automatically added to whatever filename
you enter; do not type ".dcm" in the box yourself.

Next, select your currency from the drop-down list provided.

Depending on what currency you select, the box titled *Confirm the precision of
your currency* will display a "0" with a number of decimal places to
the right of the decimal point corresponding to minor currency unit (cents,
pence or etc.) of the currency. For example, if you selected "United States
dollar (USD)", this box would display "0.00", because there are 100 cents in the
dollar. If you didn't want to keep track of cents (or whatever your minor
currency unit happens to be) you could change this box to read just "0". However
it is highly recommended that you do *not* do this. Except in some special
cases, it is best to leave this box unchanged.

When you are happy with your selections here, click *Next* and you will be taken
to the next page of the wizard.

Setting up accounts
...................

The next page asks you to enter you assets and liabilities, with the current
balances of each. An asset represents an amount of money that you "own" -
such as a chequing account or savings account - and a liability represents
an amount that you "owe" - such as a credit card balance or loan. The wizard
provides you with some suggested asset and liability accounts to get you
started; however you can and should edit these to match the accounts that you
actually have. You can edit the *Account name*, *Type*, *Description* and
*Starting balance* boxes directly. The *Description* is optional; you can enter
description of the account here for your own benefit if you feel the need.
The *Starting balance* box contains the current amount of money in the account;
in the case of a liability such as a credit card, this should normally be a
negative number. If you want to add additional accounts, click the *Add account*
button at the top right and a new row will be created for you to populate with
the details of the additional account. You can add as many other accounts as you
like. To remove accounts that you don't need, click the *Remove account* button;
this removes whatever account is at the bottom of the page.

When you've finished configuring your accounts, click *Next* at the bottom
right, to advance to the next page of the wizard.

Setting up envelopes
....................

The next page asks you to enter some revenue and expenditure categories. These
will form the initial "envelopes" that you use to classify your transactions.
As with the account setup page, you can add or remove envelopes by clicking
the button at the top right, labelled *Add envelope* in this case, or the
*Remove envelope* button, respectively. You can edit the boxes for the
*Name*, *Type* and *Description* of each envelope directly. The
*Description* field is entirely optional.

As for the *Initial allocation* box, this is to contain the amount of funds you
want to allocate to this envelope initially, for budgeting purposes.

Opening an existing DailyCashManager file
-----------------------------------------

Generally you will only want one DCM file to record all your transactions and
budgets. In your first session, you will create your DCM file. In subsequent
sessions, you will simply open your existing DCM file. There are
two ways to open an existing DCM file:
