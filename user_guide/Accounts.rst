Accounts
========

An account represents either an amount of money that you "own" - such as a
chequing account or savings account - or an amount that you "owe" - such as
a credit card balance or loan. Managing your finances using DailyCashManager,
you will keep track of the amount of money owned, or owing, in each account.

When you first set up your DailyCashManager file, you will want to create
an account in the program for each account that you have in real life.

Creating an account
-------------------

To create an account, click on the *New* in the menu bar at the top, and select
*New account* from the drop-down menu. A small panel will appear near the centre
of the screen. Enter the name of the account (e.g. "Cheque account", or "Rewards
saver", or "XYZ Bank Credit card").

In the next row, select whether the account is an asset, or a liability. An
asset represents wealth that you own, such as a bank account; whereas a
liability is a debt, something you owe - for example, a credit card or
loan.

Next enter a description for the new account in the *Description* box.
For example, you might enter "Savings account with XYZ Bank Pty Ltd". You can
leave this blank if you wish.

Then, enter the initial balance of the account in the *Initial balance* box. The
initial balance is the balance of the account on the date shown in the panel,
which is the same as the date you created your DCM file. If it's an asset
account, then this should generally be a positive number; if it's a liability,
then this will usually be a negative number.

When you're done entering the details of the new account, click *Save*. The new
account should then appear in the *Account* list at the left of the main
window.

Editing an account
------------------

If you want to edit the name, description or other properties of an account
after you've created it, you can do so either by double-clicking on the account
in the *Account* list on the left of the main window, or else by selecting the
account and then selecting *Edit selected account* from the *Edit* menu at the
top. A panel will then appear in the centre of the screen. Change things as you
see fit, then click *Save* to keep your changes, or *Cancel* to abort.

Hiding an account
-----------------

By default, all accounts are shown in the *Account* list at the left of the
main window. However, there may be times when you find you no longer need
to use a particular account. To preserve the integrity of the transactions
recorded in the DCM file, there is no way to delete an account once created;
however you can always hide an account from view, by opening the account
editing panel (see `Editing an account`_), and unchecking *Show in list*.
The account will then disappear from the list.

If you later decide you want to show the account, you can re-check the
*Show in list* box. To edit an account that is currently hidden, click
*View* at the top of the main window, and select *Show hidden accounts*
from the drop-down menu. This will cause the hidden accounts to be
displayed in the *Account* list. Double-click the account that you want to
"unhide" to bring up the account editing panel; then click *Show in list*,
and click *Save*. Then open the *View* menu again, and select *Hide
hidden accounts*. You will see that the account in question will still
be visible, even though any other hidden accounts will again be hidden
from view.
