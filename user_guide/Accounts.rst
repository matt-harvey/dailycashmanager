Accounts
========

An account represents either an amount of money that you "own" - such as a
chequing account or savings account - or an amount that you "owe" - such as
a credit card balance or loan. Managing your finanances using DailyCashManager,
you will keep track of the amount of money owned, or owing, in each account.

When you first set up your DailyCashManager file, you will want to create
an account in the program for each account that you have in real life.

Creating an account
-------------------

To create an account, click on the "New" in the menu bar at the top, and select
"New account" from the drop-down menu. A small panel will appear near the centre
of the screen. Enter the name of the account (e.g. "Cheque account", or "Rewards
saver", or "XYZ Bank Credit card").

In the next row, select whether the account is an asset, or a liability. An
asset represents wealth that you own, such as a bank account; whereas a
liability is a debt, something you owe - for example, a credit card or
loan.

Next enter a description for the new account in the "Description" box.
For example, you might enter "Savings account with XYZ Bank Pty Ltd". You can
leave this blank if you wish.

Then, enter the initial balance of the account in the "Initial balance" box. The
initial balance is the balance of the account on the date shown in the panel,
which is the same as the date you created your DCM file. If it's an asset
account, then this should generally be a positive number; if it's a liability,
then this will usually be a negative number.

When you're done entering the details of the new account, click "Save". The new
account should then appear in the "Accounts" list at the left of the main
window.
