Accounts
========

An account represents either an amount of money that you "own" - such as a
chequing account or savings account - or an amount that you "owe" - such as
a credit card balance or loan. Managing your finances using DailyCashManager,
you will keep track of the amount of money owned, or owing, in each account.

When you first set up your DailyCashManager file, you will want to create
an account in the program for each account that you have in real life.

Creating an account
-------------------

When you first set up your DCM file, you will create some accounts in the
*setup wizard* to begin with. But if you want to create further accounts at a
later time, it is easy to do so, as follows.

To create an account, click on *New* in the menu bar at the top, and select
*New account* from the resulting menu. A small panel will appear near the centre
of the screen. Enter the name of the account (e.g. "Cheque account", or "Rewards
saver", or "XYZ Bank Credit card").

In the next row, select whether the account is an asset, or a liability. An
asset represents wealth that you own, such as a bank account; whereas a
liability is a debt, something you owe - for example, a credit card or
loan.

Next enter a description for the new account in the *Description* box.
For example, you might enter "Savings account with XYZ Bank Pty Ltd". You can
leave this blank if you wish.

Finally, enter the initial balance of the account in the *Initial balance* box.
The initial balance is the balance of the account on the date shown in the
panel, which is the same as the date you created your DCM file. If the account
wasn't created in real life until after you set up the DCM file, then the
initial balance should be left as zero.

Note that if it's an asset account, then the initial balance (if it isn't zero),
should generally be a positive number; if it's a liability, then this will
generally be a negative number.

When you're done entering the details of the new account, click *Save*. The new
account should then appear in the *Account* list at the left of the main
window.

Editing an account
------------------

If you want to edit the name, description or other properties of an account
after you've created it, you can do so either by double-clicking on the account
in the *Account* list on the left of the main window, or else by selecting the
account and then selecting *Edit selected account* from the *Edit* menu at the
top. A panel will then appear in the centre of the screen. Change things as you
see fit, then click *Save* to keep your changes, or *Cancel* to abort.

Hiding an account
-----------------

By default, all accounts are shown in the *Account* list at the left of the
main window. However, there may be times when you find you no longer need
to use a particular account. To preserve the integrity of past transactions
recorded in the DCM file, there is no way to delete an account once created;
however you can hide an account from view, by opening the account
editing panel (see `Editing an account`_), and unchecking *Show in list*.
Click *Save* to save the change, and the account will then disappear from the
list.

If you later decide you want to show the account, you can re-check the
*Show in list* box, as follows. To edit the account given that it is currently
hidden, you first need to select *Show hidden accounts* from the *View* menu
at the top of the main window. This will cause all the hidden accounts to be
displayed in the *Account* list. Double-click the account that you want to
"unhide" to bring up the account editing panel; then click *Show in list*,
and *Save*. Then open the *View* menu again, and select *Hide
hidden accounts*. You will see that the account in question will still
be visible, even though any other hidden accounts will again be hidden
from view.
