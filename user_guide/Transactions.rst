Transactions
============

Every time you perform any transaction - such as spending money, receiving a
salary payment, withdrawing money from the bank, transferring funds between
bank accounts, or paying a bill - you should record the transaction in your
DCM file. 

Entering a one-off transaction
------------------------------

Most of the time you will be entering a single transaction. This is a matter
of entering the transaction details in the transaction panel at the top right
of the main window.

This is best illustrated using examples.

Example 1 - you spend $30.95 from your credit card on a meal at a restaurant:

- Select *Spend* from the transaction type box at the top left of the
  transaction panel.
- Enter "30.95" into the amount box at the top right of the transaction panel.
- In the next row, select your credit card account from box labelled *Account*.
  Enter an optional memo in the row next to the *Account* box. For example, you
  might enter the name of the restaurant.
- Select "Food" from the box labelled *Envelope*. Enter an optional memo, e.g.
  "dinner at restaurant".
- In the next row, there should be a box containing the text, "Record once only,
  on". This means you are entering a single, one-off transaction. Leave this
  as is.
- There should be a box near the bottom right of the transaction panel,
  containing today's date. If you are entering the transaction on the same day
  on which the transaction occurred (generally a good idea), you can
  leave this as is; otherwise, manually enter the date the transaction actually
  occurred in this box.
- At the bottom right of the transaction panel, click *Save* to confirm and save
  the transaction; or click *Clear* if you want to abandon this transaction
  entry and start again.

Example 2 - you earn $2000 in wages, deposited into your "XYZ Bank savings"
account:

- Select *Earn* from the transaction type box at the top left of the transaction
  panel.
- Enter "2000" into the amount box at the top right of the transaction panel.
- In the next row, select "XYZ Bank savings" from the box labelled
  *Account*. Enter an optional memo in the row next to the *Account* box. For
  example, you might enter the name of your employer.
- In the next row, select "Salary" from the box labelled *Envelope*. Enter an
  optional memo: you might enter the time period that this pay was for, for
  example; or you might simply leave this blank.
- In the next row, there should be a box containing the text, "Record once only,
  on". This means you are entering a single, one-off transaction. Leave this
  as is.
- There should be a box near the bottom right of the transaction panel,
  containing today's date. If you are entering the transaction on the same
  day on which the transaction occurred (generally a good idea), you can leave
  this as is; otherwise, manually enter the date the transaction actually
  occurred in this box.
- At the bottom right of the transaction panel, click *Save* to confirm and save
  the transaction; or click *Clear* if you want to abandon this transaction
  entry and start again.

Example 3 - you withdraw $100 in cash from your "XYZ Bank savings" account:

- Select *Account transfer* from the transaction type box at the top left of the
  transaction panel.
- Enter "100" into tha amount box at the top right of the transaction panel.
- In the next row, select "XYZ Bank savings" from the box labelled *Source*.
  Enter an optional memo in the row next to the *Source* box (for example, you
  might enter "withdraw cash at bank ATM").
- In the next row, select "Cash" from the box labelled *Destination*. Enter an
  optional memo.
- Select "Record once only, on", enter the date and click *Save*.
