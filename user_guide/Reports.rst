Reports
=======

DailyCashManager enables you to view individual transactions, filtering by date
range and account or envelope. In addition, you can view high level summary
reports. These can be useful if you want to get a quick overview of your
finances.

Balance sheet
-------------

The *Balance sheet* report enables you to see a summary of your total wealth -
assets minus liabilities - at a given point in time. To see this report, click
on the *Reports* tab, which is near the top left of the main window. Select
*Balance sheet* from the *Report type* box (if it is not already selected).
Enter the date range you are interested in in the *From* and *To* boxes. By
default, the report will show only today's balance, i.e. the account balances
as at the day on which you are running the report. Click the *Run* button
to run the report for the first time (this button will appear as *Refresh*, if
there is already a report showing in this panel, in which case you should
click *Refresh* to make sure the report is current). The report will appear in
the panel below. The *Opening balance* column shows the balance of each account
as at the date in the *From* box; and the *Closing balance* column shows the
balance as at the date entered in the *To* box. The *Movement* column shows
the increase or decrease in the account balance during this period of time.

You also have the option of leaving the *From* and/or the *To* boxes blank.
If you leave the *From* box blank, then the *Opening balance* will show the
opening balances of the accounts as at the date you created your DCM file.
If you leave the *To* box blank, then the *Closing balance* column will reflect
*all* transactions *since* the *From* date - even those which are future dated
(but it will not reflect recurring transaction occurrences that have not been
recorded yet).

Note that the *Balance sheet* report will not be automatically updated if you
record, edit or delete any transactions after you have run it. You should
*Refresh* the report each time you want to view it, to ensure it reflects the
current state of your DCM file.
