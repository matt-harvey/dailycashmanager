Reports
=======

DailyCashManager enables you to view individual transactions, filtering by date
range and account or envelope. In addition, you can view high level summary
reports. These can be useful if you want to get a quick overview of your
finances.

Balance sheet
-------------

The *Balance sheet* report enables you to see a summary of your total wealth -
assets minus liabilities - at a given point in time. To see this report, click
on the *Reports* tab, which is near the top left of the main window. Select
*Balance sheet* from the *Report type* box (if it is not already selected).
Enter the date range you are interested in in the *From* and *To* boxes. By
default, the report will show only today's balance, i.e. the account balances
as at the day on which you are running the report. Click the *Run* button
to run the report for the first time (this button will appear as *Refresh*, if
there is already a report showing in this panel, in which case you should
click *Refresh* to make sure the report is current). The report will appear in
the panel below. The *Opening balance* column shows the balance of each account
as at the date in the *From* box; and the *Closing balance* column shows the
balance as at the date entered in the *To* box. The *Movement* column shows
the increase or decrease in the account balance during this period of time.
Accounts for which the opening balance, closing balance and movement are all
nil, are not shown in the report. Note liabilities normally have
a negative balance (surrounded by brackets) and assets normally have a
positive balance.

You also have the option of leaving the *From* and/or the *To* boxes blank.
If you leave the *From* box blank, then the *Opening balance* will show the
opening balances of the accounts as at the date you created your DCM file.
If you leave the *To* box blank, then the *Closing balance* column will reflect
*all* transactions *since* the *From* date - even those which are future dated
(but it will not reflect recurring transaction occurrences that have not been
recorded yet).

Note that the *Balance sheet* report will not be automatically updated if you
record, edit or delete any transactions after you have run it. You should
*Refresh* the report each time you want to view it, to ensure it reflects the
current state of your DCM file.

Income and expenditure
----------------------

The *Income and expenditure* report enables you to see the total revenue earned,
less total spent on your various expenditure envelopes, over a given period of
time. To see this report, click on the *Reports* tab, which is near the top left
of the main window. Select *Income and expenditure* from the *Report type* box.
Enter the date range you are interested in in the *From* and *To* boxes. By
default, the report will show only your income and expenditure for the current
day - which is usually not what you are interested in. click the *Run* button to
run the report for the first time (this button will then appear as *Refresh*, if
there is already a report showing in this panel, in which case you should click
*Refresh* to make sure the report is current). The report will appear in the
panel below. The *Total* column shows the total income (for revenue envelopes)
or expenditure (for expense envelopes) for each of the envelopes listed, during
the period of time you have entered.  (Envelopes for which there has been no
revenue or expenditure for the period are not shown.) The *Daily average* column
shows the average (mean) revenue or expenditure (as the case may be) over the
selected period. This can be a useful figure to compare with the *Daily top-up*
for your various envelopes, to see if the daily top-up is realistic in light of
actual spending of a given envelope.

You also have the option of leaving the *From* and/or *To* boxes blank. If you
leave the *From* box blank, then the date you created the DCM file is treated as
the starting date for the purposes of this report. If you leave the *To* box
blank, then all transactions from the *From* date onwards are included in the
figures shown; however, the *Daily average* column will now show "N/A", as the
possibility of future-dated transactions being included in the total means any
average shown in this case would have the potential to be misleading.

Note that the *Income and expenditure* report will not be automatically updated
if you record, edit or delete any transactions after you have run it. You should
*Refresh* the report each time you want to view it, to ensure it reflects the
current state of the DCM file.
