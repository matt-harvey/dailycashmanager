Installation
============

Windows
----------

.. Put link to download path here? Or will this be elsewhere?

Go to your Downloads folder, and double-click on "DailyCashManager setup.exe".
This will start a graphical installer; then simply follow the prompts.


Linux
--------

Currently to install DCM on Linux, the application must be compiled from
source. Uncompress the tarball or zipball, and "cd" into the resulting
source directory. Follow the instructions in README to build, test
and install the application.
