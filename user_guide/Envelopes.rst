Envelopes
=========

An envelope represent a category of expense or revenue. A transaction
where you spend or earn money will generally be classified in terms of
the expense or revenue envelope that it relates to. It is up to you
what envelopes you want to create in order to categorize your transactions,
but you might typically create envelopes such as the following.

Typical expenditure envelopes:

-   Food
-   Entertainment
-   Holidays
-   Electricity
-   Bank fees

Typical revenue envelopes:

-   Salary
-   Interest received

In addition, DailyCashManager provides for a third category of envelope,
called a *pure envelopes*. A pure envelope is created in order to save for
separately for some special or one-off item that is not covered by your
day-to-day budgets; pure envelopes are discussed separately `here`_.
