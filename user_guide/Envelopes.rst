Envelopes
=========

An envelope represent a category of expense or revenue. A transaction
where you spend or earn money will generally be classified in terms of
the expense or revenue envelope that it relates to. It is up to you
what envelopes you want to create in order to categorize your transactions,
but you might typically create envelopes such as the following.

Typical expenditure envelopes:

-   Food
-   Entertainment
-   Holidays
-   Electricity
-   Bank fees

Typical revenue envelopes:

-   Salary
-   Interest received

In addition, DailyCashManager provides for a third category of envelope,
called a *pure envelope*. A pure envelope is created in order to save for
separately for some special or one-off item that is not covered by your
day-to-day budgets; pure envelopes are discussed under
`Targetted saving using pure envelopes`_.

Creating an envelope
--------------------

To create an envelope, click on *New* in the menu bar at the top, and select
*New envelope* from the resulting menu. A small panel will appear near the
centre of the screen. Enter the name of the envelope (e.g. "Groceries", or
"Salary").

Next, in the *Envelope type* box, select whether the envelope is a revenue,
expense or pure envelope.

Next, you may want to enter a description in the *Description* box. For example,
if you had an "Entertainment" envelope, you might enter "Spending on books,
music and movies" in the *Description* box. This field is optional, and is
simply for your own future reference to clarify what kind of transactions will
fall under this envelope.

You will see an *Initial budget allocation* box. This represents the initial
amount that you want to make available for spending on this category, out of
your initial total net assets (assets less liabilities), when your
DailyCashManager file is first created. For example, suppose that when
you create your file, you have $100 in cash, $200 in your bank
account, and a credit card balance of $(50). Your initial total net assets are
therefore $250 ($100 + $200 - $50). You will want to TODO

For now, you can ignore the *BUDGET ITEMS* section of this panel. This is
explained in detail under `Budgeting`_: see `Creating and editing budget
items`_.

Click *Save* at the bottom right to save the newly created envelope; or click
*Cancel* to abort, discarding the new envelope.

Editing an envelope
-------------------

If you want to edit the name, description or other properties of an envelope
after you've created it, you can do so either by double-clicking on the
envelope where it appears in the *Envelope* list (near the centre of the main
window), or else by selecting the envelope and then selecting *Edit selected
envelope* from the *Edit* menu at the top. A panel will then appear at the
centre of the screen, showing the details of the envelope. Edit things as
you see fit, then click *Save* to keep your changes, or *Cancel* to abort.

Hiding an envelope
------------------

By default, all envelopes are shown in the *Envelope* list near the centre of
the main window. However, there may be times when you find you no longer need
to use a particular envelope. To preserve the integrity of the transactions
recorded in the DCM file, there is no way to delete an envelope once created;
however you can always hide an envelope from view, by opening the envelope
editing panel (see `Editing an envelope`_), and unchecking *Show in list*.
The envelope will then disappear from the list.

If you later decide you want to show the envelope, you can re-check the
*Show in list* box, as follows. To edit an envelope that is currently hidden,
click *View* at the top of the main window, and select *Show hidden envelopes*
from the drop-down menu. This will cause the hidden envelopes to be
displayed in the *Envelope* list. Double-click the envelope that you want to
"unhide" to bring up the envelope editing panel; then click *Show in list*,
and click *Save*. Then open the *View* menu again, and select *Hide
hidden envelopes*. You will see that the envelope in question will still
be visible, even though any other hidden envelopes will again be hidden
from view.
